# NoseworkTrainer
This project is a simple dig training device which uses multiple distance sensors to detect if the dog is close to any of the sensors.

If dog spends enough time close to a selected sensor a treat signal will be given. The target time and target sensor can be selected using buttons and the current values will be displayed on the screen.
